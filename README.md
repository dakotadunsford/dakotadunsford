- Hello, I’m Dakota
- I’m interested in developing stuff for macOS and iOS. 
- I’m currently learning Swift, with an eye out for cleaner, more efficient coding practices.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are not just about code, but about building something meaningful. Whether it's an app that solves a daily problem or something that just makes people smile.
